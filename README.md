## The Libraries That I Have Used
This project was implemented using Python, leveraging the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for deep learning)

## My Project Motivation
The primary aim was to explore and analyze the Seattle Airbnb dataset to address several questions:
- Seasonal variations in pricing
- Peak seasons and their impact on pricing
- Pricing trends by neighborhood
- Influence of property types on pricing in different neighborhoods
- Sentiment analysis of reviews and their correlation with neighborhood ratings
- Price prediction based on listing features

## File Descriptions
The Jupyter notebook details the entire analysis process, including data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling. It includes markdown cells for documentation and interpretation of results.

The project folder contains:
- `calendar.csv`: Availability and price data of listings
- `listings.csv`: Detailed information about listings
- `reviews.csv`: User reviews for listings

## Summary of the Results
Key findings from the analysis include:
- The peak season for Airbnb listings in Seattle is from June to August, with July being the highest.
- The most expensive neighborhood is "Southeast Magnolia," while "Rainier Beach" is the least expensive.
- Houses in "Portage Bay" are the priciest, followed by "West Queen Anne" and "Westlake."
- Sentiment analysis of reviews revealed that most reviews are positive, with a small fraction being negative or neutral.
- Deep neural network models achieved an R^2 score of 0.51, indicating a reasonable fit, while linear regression models had a similar score, demonstrating consistent performance.
